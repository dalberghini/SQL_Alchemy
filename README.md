# SQL_Alchemy_Hawaii_Climate_Data
Temperature measurements and precipation measurements were taken from 9 different weather stations across the state of Hawaii for this data.

The original csv files are located in the Resources folder.

The jupyter notebook has the analysis and scripts and all graphs that were created have been uploaded into the Images folder.

My vacation was planned around November 20-30th. The historical data shows shows little variance in the minimum and maximum temperature recorded over the 7 years of this data.

The average temperatures over this duration only change by a degree or two and are quite pleasant as being just over 70 degrees. 

The previous year's data showed a storm passing through a portion of Hawaii with 9 inches of rain falling on one station alone, but more historical data is required to see if that portion should be avoided during this timeframe of the year.

Looking forward to it, if travel is possible this year!!
